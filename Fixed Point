Part (c) 
Under syms x in the script window below (this switches Matlab to symbolic mode): 
    i. Define  as a function handle.
    ii. Find  (calling it yprime).  
       [Note: See Newton's method code from Question #1 if you don't remember how to find the derivative]. 
    iii. For , plot both  and  on the same axes using the commands: 
        fplot(y(x),[-pi/4,pi/3],'g')  % 'g' makes the plot green. 
        hold on 
        fplot(gprime,[-pi/4,pi/3],'r') % 'r' makes the plot red.
Part (d)
Copy the code under Part (c) in the script window and paste it under Part (d).  Modify the code to add both  and  to the plot from (c).
You may want to change the colours to make identiifcation easier.  Here's a list of available colours in Matlab:

Part (e)
Use the resulting plots in parts (c) and (d) to approximate the absolute maximum and absolute minimimum of i) , ii) , iii) , and iv)  on .
State the approximations in the answer box on Gradescope.
Note: These are just approximations, but if you want to "zoom in" on a max or min value on a graph you can add the command ylim([c d]) (where [c d] is the range you want to plot on) after the last fplot() command in the script window below. 
Part (f)
Using the results from part (e), explain (in the answer box on Gradescope) why the fixed point iteration succesfully converged (or, alternatively, did not converge) to a unique fixed point of i)  and ii)  on .
Note Regarding Inputting Math in Short Answer Box in Gradescope:
You may use WeBWorK syntax to submit any 'math' in the answer boxes below, or you can try using the markup language LaTeX that's used to prepare mathematical documents to display your answers as you would write them.  To use LaTeX, simply enclose your answers in $$ and $$ and refer to the PDF of common LaTeX commands.  As an example, the statement "...for all  on ..." you would enter ...for  all  $$x$$ on $$[e^{-2},\pi]$$....
When you click out of the box it will convert it to the way you would write it.



%Part (c)
syms x
y = @(x) (sin(x+1)).^(1/3)
yprime=diff(y,x)
fplot(y(x),[-pi/4,pi/3],'y')  % 'g' makes the plot green. 
hold on 
fplot(yprime,[-pi/4,pi/3],'r') % 'r' makes the plot red.

%Part (d)
syms x
z = @(x) (sin(x+1))-x^3+x
zprime=diff(z,x)
fplot(z(x),[-pi/4,pi/3],'b')  % 'g' makes the plot green. 
hold on 
fplot(zprime,[-pi/4,pi/3],'c') % 'r' makes the plot red.
