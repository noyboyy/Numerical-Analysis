opy/paste the code from Question #1(b) for the bisection method and modify it to find the root of  on  using the regula falsi (or false position) method.  As in parts (a)-(c), use a tolerance of  between consecutive approximations for the stopping condition.

%Define g(x) as a function handle.
g=@(x)x.^3-x*cos(x)+1
%Define a_0,b_0, and c_0 as a(1),b(1), and c(1), respectively.
a(1) = -pi
b(1) = -pi/6
c(1) = b(1)-g(b(1))*(b(1)-a(1))/(g(b(1))-g(a(1)))

c1=c(1) %For marking purposes, don't change this line.
%Define the tolerance and initialize the counter as k=1. 
tolerance = 0.00001
k=1

%Define the difference as any value greater than the tolerance (e.g. 1).
difference = 1
%format long ensures that answer is stated to 15 decimals. Don't change.
format long;  
while difference>tolerance
    if g(c(k))>0
        a(k+1) = a(k);
        b(k+1) = c(k);
        
        
                %End line with a ; so all of the iterations aren't displayed in output
                %End line with a ; so all of the iterations aren't displayed in output
    else
        a(k+1) = c(k);
        b(k+1) = b(k);        %End line with a ; 
                %End line with a ;    
    end
    c(k+1)= b(k+1)-g(b(k+1))*(b(k+1)-a(k+1))/(g(b(k+1))-g(a(k+1)));
    %   p(k+1) = p(k)-g(p(k))*(p(k)-p(k-1))/(g(p(k))-g(p(k-1)))
    
    %Define c(k+1)
                %End line with a ; 
    %Recalculate the difference between consecutive c_k's
    difference = abs(c(k+1) - c(k))
    k = k+1
    %Increase counter k by 1.
    
end
c   %Displays approximations
difference %Displays difference between final consecutive approximations
